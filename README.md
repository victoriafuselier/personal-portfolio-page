 Treehouse Techdegree Project 1: Personal Profile Page

The purpose of this project was to practice web design skills by customizing a personal profile web page. I was provided starter files that included HTML, CSS, and images for the example site to be customized. I practiced my HTML and CSS skills to complete this project. 

The basic requirements for this project included: replacing background and profile images with personal photos while minding file size and practicing with a picture resizing tool--PicResize; modifying the HTML to personalize the profiles; adding functional links to social media profiles; creating at least one additional HTML file to add a second page to the site and programming navigation for the site; learning how to use GitHub/GitHub Desktop; learning how to use HTML and CSS validators to check code prior to submitting project; learning how to use Slack to collaborate with others.

The extra credit requirements for this project included: creating at least one additional page (a third page) to add to the site; editing at least one of the following CSS properties of the profile image--border, border-radius, transition, transformation; adding more photos and imagery to the page; adding more text to the page; making the HTML more semantic.

I went beyond the requirements listed above by: using my pre-existing beginner Javascript skills to add button functionality to the buttons found on the 'about me' page; adding a 4th page to the site; personalizing the site's favicon/browser icon in the browser's title tab; modifying multiple CSS properties of the profile image; using a unique profile image for all 4 pages of the site; using a unique background image for all 4 pages of the site.

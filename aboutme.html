          <p id="hobby10info" class="hidden-info">I'm no professional, but I sure do enjoy this hobby. I enjoy collecting photos of all kinds of subjects. It seems that I take, store, and print more photos than the average person, which is why I consider it a hobby of mine. I use an instant-print Polaroid camera and my good ole iPhone camera; I'm often surprised to see what kind of beautiful snaps can be captured with such basic equipment!<br><br>
                                                    Have you captured any shots you're proud of? If so, I'd love to see a few of your favorites!</p>
